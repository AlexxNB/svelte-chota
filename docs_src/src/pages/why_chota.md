# Why chota?

When you decide to use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) in your projects, you expect very tiny bundles of code.

[chota](https://jenil.github.io/chota/) is a super light-weight CSS framework, which adds only ~3kb of gzipped code to your bundle.

Svelte-chota is a UI kit for easily using [chota](https://jenil.github.io/chota/) in your [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) projects.
